Hello, I'm Namratha Nagathihalli Anantha  
I‚Äôm a data enthusiast who finds joy in making sense of complex information. Whether it‚Äôs discovering patterns, building models, or visualizing insights, I enjoy every part of the data journey. Currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Data Science at Stevens Institute of Technology, I‚Äôm continuously exploring the possibilities that data, code, and curiosity can unlock.

My work spans machine learning, big data technologies, NLP, and statistical modeling. From analyzing financial fraud to understanding emotional patterns in health discussions, I‚Äôve worked on a range of projects that reflect both technical depth and analytical thinking.

I‚Äôm currently seeking full-time opportunities as a **Data Scientist**, **Data Analyst**, **Data Engineer**, **ML Engineer** or **Business Analyst**, any role where I can keep learning, building, and contributing through data.
